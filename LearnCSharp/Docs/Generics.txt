This helps to operate on different datatypes, such that you define the datatype on which your method or class will work on as T and give the real type at creation of 
the instance of the class.
Mostly used with classes, delegates, interfaces e.t.c
Generics avoid using the object class, which otherwise is 
            // legal in C#, eventhough its causes degradation due to boxing 
            // and unboxing that is done alot
